        <h1>About Bean.co</h1>
        <p>At Bean.co, we’re more than just aficionados of legumes. We’re passionate about beans—their history, their versatility, and their impact on global cuisines. Our mission? To be the heartbeat of the bean market, connecting growers, suppliers, and enthusiasts across the world.</p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Bean.co sprouted from a humble kitchen experiment. Our founder, Isabella Green, a culinary artist with a penchant for all things bean-related, realized that beans were more than just a pantry staple—they were a cultural bridge. From the vibrant pinto beans of Mexico to the delicate adzuki beans of Japan, each variety had a story to tell.

            Driven by this revelation, Isabella set out on a journey. She traversed bean fields, spoke to farmers, and tasted countless bean dishes. Along the way, she discovered the untapped potential of the bean market. And thus, Bean.co was born.</p>
